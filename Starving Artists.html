    <br>
    Starving artists is a really fun game and it actually gives us Robux too!
    Here are some tips to make Robux faster:
    <hr>
  <ul>
      <li>You should make some attractive arts so people can buy them and you can get your Robux faster.</li>
      <li>Work hard on your drawings because everything needs time ;).</li>
      <li>Don't make your arts too expensive because you won't be able to sell your arts very quick "people buy cheap arts:)".</li>
  </ul>
      <h1>Pls Donate</h1>
  <ul>
      <li>You can be afk for a bit of time because this game needs so much time for people to buy any shirt or gamepass</li>
  </ul>
