      <p><h3>Getting Robux in Roblox is not that hard so and you can simply get Robux for
      free inside the application 'Roblox' and you'r gonna find out how to get
      Robux for free down there</h3><p>
   <hr>
      <h3>There are 2 different ways to get Robux for free:</h3>
   <ol>
      <br>
      <li>The 1st way is to join the game "Starving Artists" in Roblox and then try to draw any drawing you want
      then people could buy your arts if they liked them and you are going to recieve your robux after 7 days
      and for hanging your art up you need to make gamepasses and puting the id code of the gamepass inside the
      game "Starving Artists " And to help you a little to know how to make a gamepass you could search on YouTube
      for "How to add canvas in Starving Artists by using gamepasses" and you can choose either on phone or on pc.</li>
      <br>
      <li>The 2nd way is a bit harder than the 1st one because it needs too much time.In the 2nd way you have to
      join a game called "Pls Donate".After that you need to claim a stand 1st and then you need to wait for people
      to buy any gamepass or shirt you have made.</li>
   </ol>

      <p><h2>The 1st way actually works more than the 2nd one because there are a lot of people that buy arts in "Starving Artists"</h2></p>
